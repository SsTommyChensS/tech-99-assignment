# React + TypeScript + Vite
Steps to run this applicatopn:
1/ Install node
2/ Install packages (I've chosen Vite to create React + typescript project): npm i 
3/ Run the application: npm run dev
## Notes:
1/ When you run the application, there will have 2 components display at the browser: The improvement notes (My notes) & Refactor wallet page.
2/ I've separated the code into files, folders and styled the FE using core html & css
